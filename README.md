# cop3530-project-3-submission
Final submission for COP3530 data structures project

- Tested using 32bit mingw32 g++ compiler.

- The command 'mingw32-make' produces lyricpsy.exe.

- When you run lyricpsy.exe, sqlite3.dll should be in the same directory as the executable file.

- Option 1 in the program gives the user the option to load song data from a SQLite database. The intended database for this program can be found here:
